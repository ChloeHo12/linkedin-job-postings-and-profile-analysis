I have always had an intense passion for computer science, and my quest for knowledge in this particular bandwagon has been deepened by an intense level of fascination which I used to have for anything that was closely or remotely connected with the realm of computers. I can still recollect the memories from my childhood where I spent playing myriads of computer games with the dedication of a staunch devotee. When my academic endeavor was being addressed emphatically, I thought I had found my calling on the very occasion and decided to make my move to complete my undergraduate course in Computer Science Engineering from AKTU University.

Working as an Associate Software Developer in Novelovox Softwares for over 2+ years, I have been exposed to the varied operations of the IT industry. I was initially assigned to a project in which my role was the implementation of design, development, validation, and support activities in line with architecture requirements. I also participated in knowledge management activities intending to ensure the highest level of services to customers. Later, I have had the opportunity to comprehend the customer requirements closely, convert the requirements to optimum design and render possible solutions in the Project Management field.
  
Having worked in Novelvox for 2+ years doing different responsibilities helped me to gain in-depth knowledge of different roles in Information technology.

Julian Bornstein,Seeking entry level position in Urban Planning/Data Science/GIS | Economics/Mathematics/Urban Studies student | 2024 Graduation,"I have nearly completed my degree at Tulane and I am excited to enter the workforce. I have spent the past four years intentionally honing a diverse skillset. I have learned empirical skills including STATA, GIS, and Power BI as well as conceptual skills in mathematics, economics, and geography. I am incredibly passionate about finding ways to understand and improve the quality of our cities.
 
I have had the opportunity to work on 4 research projects; both self-guided and under faculty as a data analyst. These experiences have allowed me to bridge classroom knowledge with real-world applications. As I approach graduation, I'm eager to secure a job that leverages my existing skills and provides opportunities for further growth.
 
Currently, I am working on my honors thesis, which focuses on Airbnb's impact on rental prices in New Orleans. I am highlighting this project because it showcases my ability to take initiative as well as the skills I have already mentioned. My faculty advisor is available to help me when I am stuck, but this project is entirely self-guided. I'm responsible for crafting research questions and developing methodologies. These steps guide my work with large datasets to perform multiple-linear-regressions, create various maps of New Orleans, and generate data visualizations. Once the empirical analyses are complete, I'll craft a comprehensive paper that I intend to publish.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read my bio; I hope it provides you with a clearer picture of who I am and what I bring to the table. Please feel free to explore the rest of my profile for additional information and message me with any questions you might have.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and big data, modern successful businesses have become more data-driven. But this does not mean that we should rely on technologies and computers for everything; they are not perfect even though we tend to think they are, and they may not be able to quantify some information and then fail to correctly model. But the combination of a professional sense of humanity and advanced technologies can much more effectively avoid this kind of situation since talented professionals will consider any information that may affect the market as a factor in additional to statistical models. This kind of professionals will be people who won‚Äôt be replaced by artificial intelligence in the future, and I strive to be one of them.

Shawn Poindexter,Machine Learning Engineer at Meta,"During my graduate research in astrophysics I uncovered the first evidence of a free-floating planet while mining a dataset of gravitational microlensing events. Later, I became fascinated with a formidable modeling problem needed to better understand blackhole accretion disks. This required building and efficiently scaling a distributed simulation that performs random lookups spanning a large supercomputer cluster. My Ph.D. advisor discouraged me from working on it fearing that it was too difficult. Despite the challenges and his doubts, I persisted and solved it. This experience taught me that the computer science and data science aspects of my research were more interesting to me than science of astrophysics.

Next, I re-entered the tech industry with a mixture of consulting for clients, leading an applied research team, and exploring a variety of side projects while at Gravity Jack. Machine learning became my focus. This included organizing a meet up to help inspire and educate others in ML and deep learning. Also, I built a deep learning regression model to estimate the pose of objects seen from a monocular camera which included the development of a variety of novel data collection and data generation techniques.

Adam Nunley,Data Scientist | Data Analyst | Python | SQL | Data Wrangling/Visualization/Modeling | Machine Learning,"I am an experienced data analyst with recent training in building statistical models with machine learning. 

While working as an analyst at Milliman, much of my time was spent wrangling data for productionized risk models and then running said models to generate trading recommendations for client portfolios. I learned about the robust automation, careful verification, and agile mindset necessary to maintain models that are relied upon for time-sensitive, expensive decisions. I loved the experience and eventually wanted to demystify the models I spent so much time maintaining and that our clients spent so much money trusting.

So after a hiatus to explore the country and spend time with family - I call it my ""pre-retirement"" - I rebooted my career by completing Springboard's Data Science Career Track and learning how to create models myself. I then used my new skills in machine learning to predict the likelihood that murder cases would be solved. I also created an NLP-based recommender for listings on craigslist.

I am now hoping to join a team that will benefit from my data skills. Please feel free to contact me with any questions!

Olivia Roth,Recent College Graduate Actively Seeking Employment | UX Research & Data Analysis,"Check out my website: https://16omroth.wixsite.com/olivia-roth

Hi! My name is Olivia and I am a recent college graduate currently seeking employment in UX Research or Data Analytics.

My most recent employment was at Ulta Beauty where I started as a Prestige Beauty Advisor but was promoted within the first month of work to Lead Cashier. My job there allowed me to develop as a leader teaching fellow coworkers the POS system as well as meeting daily sales/credit card goals. Although stressful at times, the work I did there was important for me to grow as a worker and to continue learning where my passions lie. I ended my employment there at the start of 2024 due to lack of management and unrealistic pay for the responsibilities my title required. I am more driven than ever to find my career job and am actively applying for those jobs.

If you are a recruiter or have any questions or want to connect, shoot me a message!

Who am I...

I am an Ohio native from a small town just outside of Columbus, OH that had big dreams of going out to California to pursue an education about the brain. Ever since I took a Psychology class in high school I became hooked on how the brain worked. Now that I have thus completed the courses, that dream is still alive and well. With a dedication to learning and utilizing my knowledge, my personal interest is to continue learning more about the impacts of technology/media on mental health. As someone who has had immediate contact with mental health both within my family and within myself, I know what it is like to feel lost on how to cope and how best to continue...living. With that said, my core values stem from that knowledge: respect, compassion, courage, and open-mindedness. Each value is central to understanding mental health and how it affects someone's life.

In terms of my career goals, I hope to endeavor within the tech world as I have always been interested in it. I have basic knowledge of Python from my studies as well as a core drive to learn. What I may lack in experience currently, I overwhelmingly compensate in work ethic and constant need to improve.",researcher,Summary: ...graduate currently seeking employment in UX Research or Data...,Ulta Beauty,Other,Licking Heights High School,High School Diploma,High School,Other,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,579,,0

‚ÄúSuccess is a clear reflection of the effort pride and passion with which a person lives! It‚Äôs in reaching for the stars that we raise ourselves to the height of our potential. ‚Äú
My Undergraduate degree course has played a key role in developing my interest in ITM. It has given me a comprehensive exposure to courses like Database Management System, Data Warehousing, and Mining which helped me to learn the analysis of data and the administration of databases.
To enhance my skills and get hands-on experience in the field, I applied for an internship at Technocraft Institute, Nashik, where I worked as an intern in Web development. Got a hand on the technologies like HTML, CSS, Java, PHP, SQL queries, etc. Acquiring proficiency in these technologies, I developed my 3rd Year Mini Project - ‚ÄúSports club Management System Website ‚Äì ABS club‚Äù and the Final Year Project - ‚ÄúSystem for exploring Higher Education options‚Äù using Django. 
While working on a third-year project my mind was struck with a thought to digitalize my city so that it can meet the standard of the advanced tech world. Soon with the course work, I and my team commenced the start-up. Where we came up with a plan to serve the city with an E-commerce portal. Here, I got a clear perception of the subject areas like business process design, inventory management, logistics, data analysis, data handling, supply chain management, etc. As I was already interested in this field but personally working on it, I was compelled to acquire more knowledge about it. 
Endeavoring and exploring the path I am here in Texas graduating from UT Dallas to accomplish my next step towards a life worth living!

Over time, I have become more confident in my ability to communicate with others, and I am proud of who I am.

Whatever the tool is‚ÄîSQL, Excel, R‚Äîit's just a medium to gain business insights. I've used all of them to generate outputs for companies.

Never let the numbers dumbfound you again!

My team research experiences makes me different from other data science candidates. As a student leader, I led a research project on adaptive activation functions in deep learning in 2021. In addition, I applied the results of this project to another program about maize leaf disease identification. Thanks to those experiences, I became familiar with Python language and its data science toolboxes, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. Also, those research programs gave me chances to learn about the theories of most ML algorithms and apply the PyTorch framework to construct neural networks.

My internship as an NLP research assistant in IFLYTEK taught me how to deal with dirty data got from people‚Äôs daily life. In that position, I also learned to become an eligible team member by fully contributing to tasks assigned to me. Besides, I extended my ML knowledge to solve real-life problems through this experience.

My next focus areas will be causal inference and Bayesian machine learning, which I believe will add a degree of interpretability and robustness to machine learning models and thus improve the reliability of machine learning-based decision systems.

I have spent my whole life as someone whose first impulse is to optimize everything. Looking at data has always been something I've done to find patterns that show optimization. From being a semi-professional strategy gamer to a competitive soccer player, I have always analyzed data to improve myself. Pass completion rates, turnovers, and tackles made in a game helped me grow as a soccer player. Studying about the different deck matchups and my opponents allowed me to win tournaments.

Using my experiences as an athlete and competitive gamer, I have applied my skills to previous work experiences. Working at a theater camp as an intern taught me about how to engage kids with the content. I learned that connecting with different people took different strategies. I've also spent lots of time working as a volunteer with medical centers and food drives.

Brian Gratton,Always looking to the future.,"My name is Brian and I am a tried and tested Python developer. I have worked on a wide, and varied array of projects over the years. I have built data collection and aggregation tools, created APIs, designed and redesigned how data flows, and worked on everything from embedded devices to web applications with project scopes ranging from simple internal scripts, to designing full end to end system architectures.

My experiences have given me a well rounded education in what truly makes a successful software development lifecycle. Communicating an idea, be it a new feature, or an entirely new project, is absolutely critical. Clearing any ambiguity in requirements through well defined goals of functionality and scope is an essential component in any software project before even a single line of code is written. Details of implementation for the proposed solution should remain agile and fluid as the project takes form, however the objective should be well defined and remain an immutable constant for the development team as the application matures.

In my career, I have played the roles of student and teacher. There will forever be room for growth and learning. My penchant for furthering my own education is matched only by my desire to aid others in their journey. Teaching is a passion of mine and is always the highlight of my day anytime I am able to engage in it. I will never become the ideal programmer. If it were achievable, then one would not call that state of being an ‚Äúideal‚Äù. Plans do not always turn out as expected. Sometimes I break production, but I own my mistakes, learn from them, and take whatever measures are needed to assure they are not repeated. I have worked with the difficult, the excellent, the expert and the layman. I hold no pretense or self aggrandizement. I have no need or desire to be the smartest person in the room. Instead, I prefer to rely on team effort to accomplish the intended outcome. There is an old saying, ‚ÄúNo man can rule alone‚Äù.

I handled product development, hiring/ onboarding, HR, customer communication, equipment procurement, advertising creation, liability waiver drafting, worker training, and management. A one-stop-shop service for all household chores demonstrated to be a sought-after solution. By the first 8 weeks of operation, OddJob Genie had 25 part-time employees who performed a total of 203 jobs. Through the lessons, feedback, and experience of this past summer, I am currently devising an improved operations plan.

Sujhan Das,Data Engineer @ T-Mobile ,"
Hello! I'm Sujhan (pronounced Su-jhaan) 

I've lived and grown up in 5 beautiful countries, changed multiple schools, have had to start from scratch multiple times, and have really enjoyed it. Growing up, I was always immersed in detective novels, watched a lot of crime documentaries, and really aspired to become a private investigator one day. 

Then, (thankfully) I stumbled upon data. Being a data professional really helps me live my childhood dream where I get to put my detective cap üß¢ on and perform analysis to gain insights that help stakeholders make better data-driven decisions. 

After my undergrad, I took a risk of joining a start-up and learned a lot from working in a fast-paced environment with high impact. When I longed for formal education in the field of analytics I decided to pursue my Master's at the University of South Florida in Tampa. 

In my first year, I worked as a Teacher's assistant to curate a Digital Information Systems course for students of Hillsborough County, some of the students didn't have access to the internet and I really had to get those creative juices flowing! I also worked in the Student Accessibility Services to help with accommodations for disabled students. 

In my second year, I got hands-on experience with my skillset (Python, Pyspark, SQL, Azure, AWS) in the form of internships at top product companies like Panasonic and BMW. 

I really enjoy the art of exploring, acquiring, and processing raw data for different use cases, building pipelines, and putting the prepared data to use in different statistical machine-learning models.  I also like exploring different tools in cloud technologies (Azure, AWS). 

My professional strengths lie in:
‚Ä¢ Understanding Business and Data Landscape
‚Ä¢ Stakeholder Orientation
‚Ä¢ Expertise in Data Acquisition, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis
‚Ä¢ Experimentation and Innovation while creating and validating Machine Learning Models
‚Ä¢ Reporting and Sharing Results
‚Ä¢ Orchestration and Collaboration
‚Ä¢ Data Privacy and Governance

Austin N. Murray ,Data Scientist | Data Analyst | Data Enthusiast,"First and foremost, I love writing code and I‚Äôm passionate about efficiency. I enjoy finding out-of-the-box solutions for new and challenging problems.

This is exactly what I've been doing in my 8 years of management experience with 3 years in the manufacturing environment. As an engineer, it has been rewarding to use my material science academic background to standardize processes to increase efficiency in forging and use my professional experience to help train both experienced and new employees. 

As an engineer and manager, you get to see the junction between business data: telling you how to improve the department and the practical engineering data: showing there is a need to change procedures or update equipment. Then you need to be able to interpret the data to present it to the people who need to hear it. 

Problem-solving skills are a must in the manufacturing world as nothing goes the way it is expected to. Working at both a national corporation and mom-and-pop shops, I have been able to solve problems with a variety of resources.

I recently finished a data science Bootcamp with Flatiron to enhance my coding skills, take my professional experiences to new levels, and dive deeper into the data. Now I can use my problem-solving skills and pair them with coding skills to help my team push projects that had become stagnant with the help of data.

Even when I‚Äôm not at work, I find myself writing code in my personal life and for those around me. For instance, this Spring I am developing a project to establish trends of an eCommerce store to optimize the inventory of my family‚Äôs small business. I plan to increase sales and reduce on-hand inventory.

I am confident that I can use my engineering experience and my experience analyzing data to help a company achieve its goals. In return, I‚Äôm looking to join a company that can provide challenges, cares about work-life balance, and helps me continue to learn and grow. A place where my work can help make an impact.

During the summer of 2023, I was a software engineer intern at eBay's buyer experience group. During that internship, I did two projects. The first is about creating a new way to store user's previous selections, which can be extensible for all the buyer-side business programs. In this project, I had to design and develop a new approach to efficiently store and retrieve data and determine the user's preferred position for reminding them of their previous selections. My second project was to design and develop an internal debug tool for the buyer experience group. This tool needs to capture all the requests and responses for all the downstream APIs and show the integrated information in the front end. I employed the Kotlin and GraphQL API for the backend of this tool and React, node.js and TypeScript for the front end.

I also did some projects in the AI and machine learning field. For example, in 2023, I led a team to design and develop a facial recognition system to detect and track real-time threats in public spaces. I was responsible for finding the suitable, training the model, and packaging it to the backend of this system. And this system has begun to be tested around UCLA in the police department.

Juyi ‚ÄúJohnny‚Äù Yang,UCLA Data Science student seeking for Internships,"Greetings! I am a graduate student at UCLA majoring in Applied Statistics and Data Science. Having arrived in the United States at the age of 14, I have been greatly influenced by both Eastern and Western cultures. I spent two years in Kansas for high school and two years in the Bay Area for community college, where I was elected as the youngest and first Chinese student body president in college history at age 17.

After completing my undergraduate studies in Economics and working for a year, I decided to return to school and enhance my technical background. My post-graduation aspirations involve pursuing roles in Data science and Product Management.

Prior to UCLA, I served as the President of Ca√±ada College, representing over 6,500 students. While maintaining a high standard of academic excellence, I managed a diverse team comprising 40% of international students and 60% of historically underrepresented students. Together, we organized more than 20 campus-wide events. I led my team in drafting the college's first-ever housing resolution to provide university housing for low-income students. This resolution is currently under review by the College Presidents and District Board of Trustees and, upon approval, will be passed on to the Redwood City Council.

At UCLA, I continued my commitment to student advocacy after being selected by the President to serve as his Chief of Staff. I successfully managed three impactful platforms, including a strategic partnership with residential leads to reduce laundry costs from $2.75 to $1.50 for the next 20 years, resulting in over $500,000 in annual savings for on-campus residents. I was also chosen as the only representative from China to be an inaugural member of the UCLA Chancellor's Leadership, Innovation, Networking, and Knowledge (LINK) program, which provided me with an opportunity to network with industry-leading professionals and social movement leaders from around the world, including billionaire philanthropist Meyers Luskin.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking (you can find me on Instagram @Luka_sauce), competing in E-sports (Top 0.5% in Global NBA2k Gaming), practicing traditional Chinese tea art, playing basketball, singing, and modeling.

Ivan Santa Maria Filho,Google BigData and ML for Data Scientists,"The two obvious themes on my career have been designing highly scalable systems and performance engineering. The less obvious is that I seek experiences that help me learn different aspects of software development. At this point I have had the pleasure of working from DC design and some aspects of their operation, cloud fabrics, operating system development (file systems, high availability, and drivers), cluster management software, RDBMS (SQL Server), very large disaggregate storage systems, multi-billion job/day workflow systems, and one of the world's top 3 largest analytics engines (~10k containers/second, jobs routinely processing PBs of data).

Professional work I really enjoy:
* Talking to customers, learn their business, and gather/translate requirements.
* Performance benchmarking and analysis.
* Large systems design and architecture. 
* Team leadership. Forming and improving teams, coaching, mentoring, and professional development of team members.

Professional work I grew to dislike: 
* Design and coding interviews (giving and taking). What most of the industry does today is akin to test whether someone can ride a bicycle so they can join the swimming team.  If I ever interview you I promise it will be different :)
* Email, chat, intranet social media in their multiple apps, plus the never ending corporate spam. 
* Being on-call 24x7. 

Trivia:
* Biggest team I ever managed - about 60 people.
* Most distributed product - 4 countries and 6 time zones. 
* Longest single project - 5.5 years. 
* Biggest budget - About a billion USD/year, with varying degrees of influence. 
* Most travel - Once a week across states, plus 5 international trips in a year for 3 years. 
* Languages - Fluent in English and Portuguese, and rudimentary Spanish. 
* I have three passports (EU, US, and Brazil).
* I've been part of two major software disasters. Pay me coffee and I'll share.

Anthony Ho,Looking for a job! ,"-Tested Xbox games for many years had several positions.
I believe that the skill I excel in the most, my love and passion is game development. 
-I turn kind of boring games that had potential, into really fun, exciting games by changing them with editing programs on games like Grand Theft Auto 5, and Warcraft 3.
- I studied C# programming while at Renton Technical College and used it to improve games.
-On GTA 5 I would gather up to 30 players at a time to play a playlist of 16 games, most were created by me.
-On Warcraft 3 I used some coding to improve games for up to 12 players at a time and they loved it. I changed, dodgeball projectile properties, field layout, music and sounds with specific timings and learned a lot about how to make games fun.
-Used feedback from other players to make games better. Used complaints as constructive criticism. Received a lot of praise and compliments too.
-Gained 3000 followers on Xbox, mainly from my GTA missions I created.
-Have over 1300 members in my Xbox club I created named ""Club Bboy DxT GTA 5 Custom Created Missions Playlist Group POSTs"".
-on Warcraft 3, I turned a boring game of dodgeball into a game I renamed Dodgeball 3D. I changed the layout of the field, added sound effects and linked it to abilities, changed the dodgeball's projectile properties like speed, distance, and hitboxs and much more. I added character models into the game that other players wanted, or as a reward for them winning a tournament. I got to use some of the programming I learned while doing this in the editor which was really cool.
-Created programs in Visual Studios using C# programming language to make programs like...
The Inspirational Clock, which was just a small program that displayed the time better, but also displayed inspirational quotes or knowledge to make people's lives better. It had functions like add, edit, remove inspirations, an interval timer on when it changes the quote, and other things. I was really into Tony Robbins at the time. It was cool to sell on eBay and get so much wonderful feedback from the buyers that I would post their feedback too and also they would sometimes share their quotes too, because I suggested it.
-Created a breakdance moves program using Visual Studios and C# to save dance moves with video and details so that they can have their own little database and have a fun way to improve their moves. Physical health is important too and it made it more fun to do.

Archit S.,,"Funny story, I didn't initially set out to become a Data Scientist. My journey began during my MBA in Business Intelligence at Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies. I dabbled in a course on Neural Networks, and it was akin to discovering a new universe. The fusion of analytics, programming, and strategic thinking felt like the sweet spot I had been searching for.

My deep dive into the world of data kicked off at Nielsen IQ in Mumbai. As the newbie Data Analyst on the block, age and experience might have put me at the rank of an underdog. However, by leveraging keen insights from FMCG data, I championed a strategy that skyrocketed product sales by a whopping 120%. It's a testament to the magic that numbers, when understood, can weave.

Apart from my love for Data Science, you might find me delving into AR projects or even crafting AI models for board games like Tic Tac Toe. These pursuits, though seeming diverse, share the same essence of challenge and innovation, much like navigating the vast terrains of data. When it comes to data, I don't just see numbers; I visualize potential, strategy, and game-changing insights.

If you're on the hunt for someone who can navigate the intricate labyrinths of data and carve out actionable insights, I'd be thrilled to connect. Drop me a line at architsengupta@arizona.edu. Let's chart a course to transform your data into tangible success stories.
